# Live-Well

The goal of our project Live Well - Digital Wellbeing is to design technology in such a way 
that it promotes healthy use and proactively assists the user to maintain a healthy lifestyle. They help 
the user to lower undesired types of screen time, or to be more deliberate about how technology is 
used.

A large number of teenagers as well as adults find themselves caught up amidst the intertwined 
network of social media, streaming service apps, games and a lot of other stuff in the digital world 
which are easy to get hooked on to which can really hinder the productivity and credibility of the 
individual. 
To tackle with this situation and help teenagers to be productive and aware of their device 
usage our group came up with the idea of an app that will notify the user if he over-extends his device 
usage with an application namely “Live – Well”, i.e., a digital well-being app. 

As the developer of a new application, it gives a potentially greatly increased user base, whilst 
not creating too high an additional coding burden. A new application can also benet from the 
advantage of non-recurring engineering allowing greater sophistication in the use of such an API. 
This project also explores the possibility that a user may wish to control an application from multiple 
locations regardless of the device that they have access to at that point in time - the fact that the user 
should not be limited to the case where they are physically in front of a computer hosting the software.
